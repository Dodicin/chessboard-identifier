# Chessboard Identifier - chessboard scheme photo to FEN string prediction

Chessboard Identifier is a MATLAB library for recognizing chess schemes from schematized diagrams.

## How it works:
Execute main_streamlined.m in MATLAB. In opens by default the photo directory in the root of the project, but you can choose a photo of your own choosing. It will then try to predict the pieces on the chessboard, outputting a FEN string representing their disposition.

More info on how the pipeline works can be found under `presentation/presentation.pdf`.

## To do:
Rationalize project structure and code.
