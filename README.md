# Chessboard Identifier - chessboard scheme photo to FEN string prediction

This is the MATLAB project for my Image Processing course.

## How it works:
Execute main_streamlined.m in MATLAB. In opens by default the photo directory in the root of the project, but you can choose a photo of your own choosing.
